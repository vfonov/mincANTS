	a best appearance template and the best appearance and shape template
	proposed here and implemented in the open source toolkit Advanced

	optimal shape and appearance template construction outperforms the
	other strategies for gaining data-derived templates. Our results
	also show the improvement is most significant on the diseased side
	and insignificant on the healthy side. Thus, the importance of the
	template increases when used to study pathology and may be less critical
	for normal control studies. Furthermore, explicit geometric optimization

  number = {4},
  abstract = {This paper has reviewed, with somewhat variable coverage, the nine
	MR image segmentation techniques itemized in Table II. A wide array
	of approaches have been discussed; each has its merits and drawbacks.
	We have also given pointers to other approaches not discussed in
	depth in this review. The methods reviewed fall roughly into four
	model groups: c-means, maximum likelihood, neural networks, and k-nearest
	neighbor rules. Both supervised and unsupervised schemes require
	human intervention to obtain clinically useful results in MR segmentation.
	Unsupervised techniques require somewhat less interaction on a per
	patient/image basis. Maximum likelihood techniques have had some
	success, but are very susceptible to the choice of training region,
	which may need to be chosen slice by slice for even one patient.
	Generally, techniques that must assume an underlying statistical
	distribution of the data (such as LML and UML) do not appear promising,
	since tissue regions of interest do not usually obey the distributional
	tendencies of probability density functions. The most promising supervised
	techniques reviewed seem to be FF/NN methods that allow hidden layers
	to be configured as examples are presented to the system. An example
	of a self-configuring network, FF/CC, was also discussed. The relatively
	simple k-nearest neighbor rule algorithms (hard and fuzzy) have also
	shown promise in the supervised category. Unsupervised techniques
	based upon fuzzy c-means clustering algorithms have also shown great
	promise in MR image segmentation. Several unsupervised connectionist
	techniques have recently been experimented with on MR images of the
	brain and have provided promising initial results. A pixel-intensity-based
	edge detection algorithm has recently been used to provide promising
	segmentations of the brain. This is also an unsupervised technique,
	older versions of which have been susceptible to oversegmenting the
	image because of the lack of clear boundaries between tissue types
	or finding uninteresting boundaries between slightly different types
	of the same tissue. To conclude, we offer some remarks about improving
	MR segmentation techniques. The better unsupervised techniques are
	too slow. Improving speed via parallelization and optimization will
	improve their competitiveness with, e.g., the k-nn rule, which is
	the fastest technique covered in this review. Another area for development
	is dynamic cluster validity. Unsupervised methods need better ways
	to specify and adjust c, the number of tissue classes found by the
	algorithm. Initialization is a third important area of research.
	Many of the schemes listed in Table II are sensitive to good initialization,
	both in terms of the parameters of the design, as well as operator
	selection of training data.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	of four previously proposed automatic brain tissue segmentation methods:
	FAST, SPM5, an automatically trained k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier,
	and a conventional kNN classifier based on a prior training set.
	The intensity nonuniformity correction and skull-stripping mask were
	the same for all methods. Evaluations were performed on MRI scans
	of elderly subjects derived from the general population. Accuracy
	was evaluated by comparison to two manual segmentations of MRI scans
	of six subjects (mean age 65.9+/-4.4 years). Reproducibility was
	assessed by comparing the automatic segmentations of 30 subjects
	(mean age 57.0+/-3.7 years) who were scanned twice within a short
	time interval. All methods showed good accuracy and reproducibility,
	with only small differences between methods. The conventional kNN
	classifier was the most accurate method with similarity indices of
	0.82/0.90/0.94 for cerebrospinal fluid/gray matter/white matter,
	but it showed the lowest reproducibility. FAST yielded the most reproducible
	segmentation volumes with volume difference standard deviations of
	0.55/0.49/0.38 (percentage of intracranial volume) respectively.
	The results of the reproducibility experiment can be used to calculate
	the required number of subjects in the design of a longitudinal study
	with sufficient power to detect changes over time in brain (tissue)
	volume. Example sample size calculations demonstrate a rather large
	effect of the choice of segmentation method on the required number

	are increasingly important but can be degraded by intensity non-uniformity.
	This non-uniformity can be more pronounced at higher field strengths,
	or when using multichannel receiver coils. We assessed the ability
	of the non-parametric non-uniform intensity normalization (N3) technique
	to correct non-uniformity in 72 volumetric brain MR scans from the
	preparatory phase of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
	(ADNI). Normal elderly subjects (n=18) were scanned on different
	3-T scanners with a multichannel phased array receiver coil at baseline,
	using magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MP-RAGE) and spoiled
	gradient echo (SPGR) pulse sequences, and again 2 weeks later. When
	applying N3, we used five brain masks of varying accuracy and four
	spline smoothing distances (d=50, 100, 150 and 200 mm) to ascertain
	which combination of parameters optimally reduces the non-uniformity.
	We used the normalized white matter intensity variance (standard
	deviation/mean) to ascertain quantitatively the correction for a
	single scan; we used the variance of the normalized difference image
	to assess quantitatively the consistency of the correction over time
	from registered scan pairs. Our results showed statistically significant
	(p<0.01) improvement in uniformity for individual scans and reduction
	in the normalized difference image variance when using masks that
	identified distinct brain tissue classes, and when using smaller
	spline smoothing distances (e.g., 50-100 mm) for both MP-RAGE and
	SPGR pulse sequences. These optimized settings may assist future
	large-scale studies where 3-T scanners and phased array receiver
	coils are used, such as ADNI, so that intensity non-uniformity does
	not influence the power of MR imaging to detect disease progression

  abstract = {In order to localize cerebral cognitive or sensorimotor function,
	activation paradigms are being used in conjunction with PET measures
	of cerebral activity (e.g., rCBF). The changes in local cerebral
	activity have two components: a global, region independent change
	and a local or regional change. As the first step in localizing the
	regional effects of an activation, global variance must be removed
	by a normalization procedure. A simple normalization procedure is
	division of regional values by the whole brain mean. This requires
	the dependence of local activity on global activity to be one of
	simple proportionality. This is shown not to be the case. Furthermore,
	a systematic deviation from a proportional relationship across brain
	regions is demonstrated. Consequently, any normalization must be
	approached on a pixel-by-pixel basis by measuring the change in local
	activity and change in global activity. The changes associated with
	an activation can be partitioned into global and local effects according
	to two models: one assumes that the increase in local activity depends
	on global values and the other assumes independence. It is shown
	that the increase in activity due to a cognitive activation is independent
	of global activity. This independence of the (activation) condition
	effect and the confounding linear effect of global activity on observed
	local activity meet the requirements for an analysis of covariance,
	with the "nuisance" variable as global activity and the activation
	condition as the categorical independent variable. These conclusions
	are based on analysis of data from 24 scans: six conditions over
	four normal subjects using a verbal fluency paradigm.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED

	Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed

	The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines
	its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov
	random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an
	MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural
	mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics
	of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring,
	nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the
	posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image
	model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another
	(imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the
	physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what
	is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution.
	The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the
	maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded
	observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm
	for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm
	and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations

  abstract = {Systematic mapping of the variability in cortical sulcal anatomy is
	an area of increasing interest which presents numerous methodological
	challenges. To address these issues, we have implemented sulcal extraction
	and assisted labeling (SEAL) to automatically extract the two-dimensional
	(2-D) surface ribbons that represent the median axis of cerebral
	sulci and to neuroanatomically label these entities. To encode the
	extracted three-dimensional (3-D) cortical sulcal schematic topography
	(CSST) we define a relational graph structure composed of two main
	features: vertices (representing sulci) and arcs (representing the
	relationships between sulci). Vertices contain a parametric representation
	of the surface ribbon buried within the sulcus. Points on this surface
	are expressed in stereotaxic coordinates (i.e., with respect to a
	standardized brain coordinate system). For each of these vertices,
	we store length, depth, and orientation as well as anatomical attributes
	(e.g., hemisphere, lobe, sulcus type, etc.). Each arc stores the
	3-D location of the junction between sulci as well as a list of its
	connecting sulci. Sulcal labeling is performed semiautomatically
	by selecting a sulcal entity in the CSST and selecting from a menu
	of candidate sulcus names. In order to help the user in the labeling
	task, the menu is restricted to the most likely candidates by using
	priors for the expected sulcal spatial distribution. These priors,
	i.e., sulcal probabilistic maps, were created from the spatial distribution
	of 34 sulci traced manually on 36 different subjects. Given these
	spatial probability maps, the user is provided with the likelihood
	that the selected entity belongs to a particular sulcus. The cortical
	structure representation obtained by SEAL is suitable to extract
	statistical information about both the spatial and the structural
	composition of the cerebral cortical topography. This methodology
	allows for the iterative construction of a successively more complete
	statistical models of the cerebral topography containing spatial
	distributions of the most important structures, their morphometrics,
	and their structural components.},

  abstract = {Mindboggle (http://www.binarybottle.com/mindboggle.html) is a fully
	automated, feature matching approach to label cortical structures
	and activity anatomically in human brain MRI data. This approach
	does not assume that the existence of component structures and their
	relative spatial relationship is preserved from brain to brain, but
	instead disassembles a labeled atlas and reassembles its pieces to
	match corresponding pieces in an unlabeled subject brain before labeling.
	Mindboggle: (1) converts linearly coregistered subject and atlas
	MRI data into sulcus pieces, (2) matches each atlas piece with a
	combination of subject pieces by minimizing a cost function, (3)
	transforms atlas label boundaries to the matching subject pieces,
	(4) warps atlas labels to their transformed boundaries, and (5) propagates
	labels to fill remaining gaps in a mask derived from the subject
	brain. We compared Mindboggle with four registration methods: linear
	registration, and nonlinear registration using SPM2, AIR, and ANIMAL.
	Automated labeling by all of the nonlinear methods was found to be
	at least comparable with linear registration. Mindboggle outperformed
	every other method, as measured by the agreement between overlapping
	atlas labels and manually assigned subject labels, with respect to
	the union or the intersection of voxels. After applying the same
	procedure that Mindboggle uses to fill a subject's segmented gray
	matter mask with labels (step 5), the results of the other methods
	improved. However, after performing a one-way ANOVA (and Tukey's
	honestly significant difference criterion) in a multiple comparison
	between the results obtained by the different methods, Mindboggle
	was still found to be the only nonlinear method whose labeling performance
	was significantly better than that of linear registration or SPM2.
	Further advantages to Mindboggle include a high degree of robustness
	against image artifacts, poor image quality, and incomplete brain
	data. We tested the latter hypothesis by conducting all of the tests
	again, this time registering the atlas to an artificially lesioned
	version of itself, and found that Mindboggle was the only method
	whose performance did not degrade significantly as the lesion size
	increased.},

	resonance (MR) scans is a challenging problem that has received an
	enormous amount of attention lately. Of the techniques reported in
	the literature, very few are fully automatic. In this paper, we present
	an efficient and accurate, fully automatic 3-D segmentation procedure
	for brain MR scans. It has several salient features; namely, the
	following. 1) Instead of a single multiplicative bias field that
	affects all tissue intensities, separate parametric smooth models
	are used for the intensity of each class. 2) A brain atlas is used
	in conjunction with a robust registration procedure to find a nonrigid
	transformation that maps the standard brain to the specimen to be
	segmented. This transformation is then used to: segment the brain
	from nonbrain tissue; compute prior probabilities for each class
	at each voxel location and find an appropriate automatic initialization.
	3) Finally, a novel algorithm is presented which is a variant of
	the expectation-maximization procedure, that incorporates a fast
	and accurate way to find optimal segmentations, given the intensity
	models along with the spatial coherence assumption. Experimental
	results with both synthetic and real data are included, as well as
	comparisons of the performance of our algorithm with that of other

	volume may be composed of a mixture of several tissue types due to
	partial volume effects. Therefore, we consider that in a brain dataset
	there are not only the three main types of brain tissue: gray matter,
	white matter, and cerebro spinal fluid, called pure classes, but
	also mixtures, called mixclasses. A statistical model of the mixtures
	is proposed and studied by means of simulations. It is shown that
	it can be approximated by a Gaussian function under some conditions.
	The D'Agostino-Pearson normality test is used to assess the risk
	alpha of the approximation. In order to classify a brain into three
	types of brain tissue and deal with the problem of partial volume
	effects, the proposed algorithm uses two steps: 1) segmentation of
	the brain into pure and mixclasses using the mixture model; 2) reclassification
	of the mixclasses into the pure classes using knowledge about the
	obtained pure classes. Both steps use Markov random field (MRF) models.
	The multifractal dimension, describing the topology of the brain,
	is added to the MRFs to improve discrimination of the mixclasses.
	The algorithm is evaluated using both simulated images and real MR
	images with different T1-weighted acquisition sequences.},

  abstract = {Accurate tissue and structure segmentation of magnetic resonance (MR)
	brain scans is critical in several applications. In most approaches
	this task is handled through two sequential steps. We propose to
	carry out cooperatively both tissue and subcortical structure segmentation
	by distributing a set of local and cooperative Markov random field
	(MRF) models Tissue segmentation is performed by partitioning the
	volume into subvolumes where local MRFs are estimated in cooperation
	with their neighbors to ensure consistency. Local estimation fits
	precisely to the local intensity distribution and thus handles nonuniformity
	of intensity without any bias field modelization. Similarly, subcortical
	structure segmentation is performed via local MRF models that integrate
	localization constraints provided by a priori fuzzy description of
	brain anatomy. Subcortical structure segmentation is not reduced
	to a subsequent processing step but joined with tissue segmentation:
	the two procedures cooperate to gradually and conjointly improve
	model accuracy. We propose a framework to implement this distributed
	modeling integrating cooperation, coordination, and local model checking
	in an efficient way. Its evaluation was performed using both phantoms
	and real 3 T brain scans, showing good results and in particular
	robustness to nonuniformity and noise with a low computational cost.
	This original combination of local MRF models, including anatomical
	knowledge, appears as a powerful and promising approach for MR brain
	scan segmentation.},

  abstract = {We describe the construction of a digital brain atlas composed of
	data from manually delineated MRI data. A total of 56 structures
	were labeled in MRI of 40 healthy, normal volunteers. This labeling
	was performed according to a set of protocols developed for this
	project. Pairs of raters were assigned to each structure and trained
	on the protocol for that structure. Each rater pair was tested for
	concordance on 6 of the 40 brains; once they had achieved reliability
	standards, they divided the task of delineating the remaining 34
	brains. The data were then spatially normalized to well-known templates
	using 3 popular algorithms: AIR5.2.5's nonlinear warp (Woods et al.,
	1998) paired with the ICBM452 Warp 5 atlas (Rex et al., 2003), FSL's
	FLIRT (Smith et al., 2004) was paired with its own template, a skull-stripped
	version of the ICBM152 T1 average; and SPM5's unified segmentation
	method (Ashburner and Friston, 2005) was paired with its canonical
	brain, the whole head ICBM152 T1 average. We thus produced 3 variants
	of our atlas, where each was constructed from 40 representative samples
	of a data processing stream that one might use for analysis. For
	each normalization algorithm, the individual structure delineations
	were then resampled according to the computed transformations. We
	next computed averages at each voxel location to estimate the probability
	of that voxel belonging to each of the 56 structures. Each version
	of the atlas contains, for every voxel, probability densities for
	each region, thus providing a resource for automated probabilistic
	labeling of external data types registered into standard spaces;
	we also computed average intensity images and tissue density maps
	based on the three methods and target spaces. These atlases will
	serve as a resource for diverse applications including meta-analysis
	of functional and structural imaging data and other bioinformatics
	applications where display of arbitrary labels in probabilistically
	defined anatomic space will facilitate both knowledge-based development

	paper is an attempt to review the state-of-the-art 2-D and 3-D cerebral
	cortical segmentation techniques from brain magnetic resonance imaging
	based on three main classes: region-based, boundary/surface-based
	and fusion of boundary/surface-based with region-based techniques.
	In the first class, region-based techniques, we demonstrated more
	than 18 different techniques for segmenting the cerebral cortex from
	brain slices acquired in orthogonal directions. In the second class,
	boundary/surface-based, we showed more than ten different techniques
	to segment the cerebral cortex from magnetic resonance brain volumes.
	Particular emphasis will be placed by presenting four state-of-the-art
	systems in the third class, based on the fusion of boundary/surface-based
	with region-based techniques outlined in Part II of the paper, also
	called regional-geometric deformation models, which take the paradigm
	of partial differential equations in the level set framework. We
	also discuss the pros and cons of various techniques, besides giving
	the mathematical foundations for each sub-class in the cortical taxonomy.},

	accuracy of the algorithms developed so far is, however, largely
	dependent on the performance of segmentation methods partitioning
	MRI brain data into its main classes, namely gray matter (GM), white

	of three brain MRI segmentation algorithms using simulated and clinical
	brain MR data was performed, and subsequently their impact on PVC
	in 18F-FDG and 18F-DOPA brain PET imaging was assessed. Two algorithms,
	the first is bundled in the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM2)
	package while the other is the Expectation Maximization Segmentation
	(EMS) algorithm, incorporate a priori probability images derived
	from MR images of a large number of subjects. The third, here referred
	to as the HBSA algorithm, is a histogram-based segmentation algorithm
	incorporating an Expectation Maximization approach to model a four-Gaussian
	mixture for both global and local histograms. Simulated under different
	combinations of noise and intensity non-uniformity, MR brain phantoms
	with known true volumes for the different brain classes were generated.
	The algorithms' performance was checked by calculating the kappa
	index assessing similarities with the "ground truth" as well as multiclass
	type I and type II errors including misclassification rates. The
	impact of image segmentation algorithms on PVC was then quantified
	using clinical data. The segmented tissues of patients' brain MRI
	were given as input to the region of interest (RoI)-based geometric
	transfer matrix (GTM) PVC algorithm, and quantitative comparisons
	were made. The results of digital MRI phantom studies suggest that
	the use of HBSA produces the best performance for WM classification.
	For GM classification, it is suggested to use the EMS. Segmentation
	performed on clinical MRI data show quite substantial differences,
	especially when lesions are present. For the particular case of PVC,
	SPM2 and EMS algorithms show very similar results and may be used
	interchangeably. The use of HBSA is not recommended for PVC. The
	partial volume corrected activities in some regions of the brain
	show quite large relative differences when performing paired analysis
	on 2 algorithms, implying a careful choice of the segmentation algorithm
	for GTM-based PVC.},

  abstract = {The finite mixture (FM) model is the most commonly used model for
	statistical segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images
	because of its simple mathematical form and the piecewise constant
	nature of ideal brain MR images. However, being a histogram-based
	model, the FM has an intrinsic limitation--no spatial information
	is taken into account. This causes the FM model to work only on well-defined
	images with low levels of noise; unfortunately, this is often not
	the the case due to artifacts such as partial volume effect and bias
	field distortion. Under these conditions, FM model-based methods
	produce unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel hidden
	Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a stochastic process generated
	by a MRF whose state sequence cannot be observed directly but which
	can be indirectly estimated through observations. Mathematically,
	it can be shown that the FM model is a degenerate version of the
	HMRF model. The advantage of the HMRF model derives from the way
	in which the spatial information is encoded through the mutual influences
	of neighboring sites. Although MRF modeling has been employed in
	MR image segmentation by other researchers, most reported methods
	are limited to using MRF as a general prior in an FM model-based
	approach. To fit the HMRF model, an EM algorithm is used. We show
	that by incorporating both the HMRF model and the EM algorithm into
	a HMRF-EM framework, an accurate and robust segmentation can be achieved.
	More importantly, the HMRF-EM framework can easily be combined with
	other techniques. As an example, we show how the bias field correction
	algorithm of Guillemaud and Brady (1997) can be incorporated into
	this framework to achieve a three-dimensional fully automated approach
	for brain MR image segmentation.},
